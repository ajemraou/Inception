    - **Simplified management: Run MariaDB, Nginx, and WordPress in separate containers.**<br/>
    - **Consistent configuration: Ensures uniformity across environments.**<br/>
    - **Data persistence: Guarantees website data isn't lost with volume allocation.**<br/>
    - **Seamless communication: Leverages Docker's network for smooth interaction between containers.**<br/>
