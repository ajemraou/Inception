#Intorduction:
this project utilizes Docker to provide a hands-on understanding of its core concepts:
    - - **The fundamentals of Docker operation and commands**
    - - **How to Configure Nginx as a Reverse Proxy**
    - - **Configuration of WordPress and Interaction with MariaDB**
    - - **Creating Your First Custom Docker-Compose File Using YAML**

#User story:
As a developer, I want to use Docker Compose for a hassle-free WordPress website deployment. This offers:
    - - **Simplified management: Run MariaDB, Nginx, and WordPress in separate containers.**
    - - **Consistent configuration: Ensures uniformity across environments.**
    - - **Data persistence: Guarantees website data isn't lost with volume allocation.**
    - - **Seamless communication: Leverages Docker's network for smooth interaction between containers.**
